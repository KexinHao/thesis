          This thesis is about the nostalgia in Chinese pop music in the last thirty years of the 20th century. It investigates the nostalgia embedded in the music: what is the nostalgia addressed by the songs? What did people feel nostalgic about and how did it come in shape in relation to the society and culture?

          From the emerging folk music in Taiwan in the 70s and the 80s, to the classic rock in Hong Kong’s “golden age”, and to the heavy metal from Beijing’s music scene in the early 90s, the thesis examines the nostalgia in the music, songwriting, and its consumption—through the lens of a “light-weighted” media, a folk document, and an important art form: pop music.

          Nostalgia is about longing, especially for an unvisited place. It mourns for a displacement in time and space, and yearns for either a realistic or a mythical return. It is also about belonging to a place or a community. One type of it is about belonging to a nation, one’s homeland.

          Chinese language and culture shape the nostalgia in the music. In contrast to the west, nostalgia in Chinese pop music is expressed differently, with a language that is more impersonal and general. How people conceive time influences how people feel nostalgic. Some nostalgic narratives in the music show that the Chinese conception of time is a non-linear one.

          Restorative nostalgia attempts to restore the lost home, the origin, and the tradition. Reflective nostalgia focuses on the longing itself and delays the homecoming. These two types of nostalgia can co-exist and intertwine in one song.

          Music as an art form grows into space,  performance, aesthetics, and social interaction—Karaoke can be a place for people to indulge in nostalgia.

          It was a steamy never-ending summer night in Beijing. I was going to karaoke with a bunch of friends, to the one called “PARTYWORLD”. It is a giant building with a lot of private lounges, each installed with a karaoke set. A karaoke night is a regular activity we would do a dozen of times throughout a year.

          One of the greatest things to do in karaoke is to embrace the enormous nostalgia the songs carry out. We would order songs from the times of our youth or even before we were born. You would wait until your crush ordered a song that could hit you hard. It reminded you of a horny, painful, and overly self-indulgent adolescent you once had. You secretly looked at him while he sang that song and you wondered how he related to it himself. Not before the music video finished its last bits of blurring-off, someone cut it and jumped to the next song Romantic Cellphones. The whole crowd was excited and screaming the every single word in the lyrics—it was the song that swept through streets back then and advertised a clamshell phone of which every kid dreamt in the year 2005. In karaoke, a party themed on nostalgia is happening in every second. And everyone sings about the past, the past that renders with future, and a personal past paralleled with others’ or intertwined with a collective past.

          The year 2020 with the global pandemic doesn't allow me to imagine such a gathering in karaoke. Neither does it permit me any chances to go back home(China). These impossibilities make things more unreachable thus more desirable. And this is why I started to binge consume Chinese pop music I used to listen to—it is how I could indulge in my nostalgia.

          The music, the act of listening, and the singing are about remembrance. Not only did the old Chinese pop music open the box of my own memories, but it also unboxed other’s nostalgia to me: the nostalgia of the songwriters, the audience, and the societies. I decided to write about it.

          I spent a whole summer digging in my memories and the internet, trying to remember or to look for nostalgic Chinese music. I ended up with an endless playlist. Hundreds of songs about “hometown”, “the past” and “old lover” ranged from 70s Taipei and 90s Beijing, played over and over in my headphones for months at night, and would always replay from the start the next morning, on my daily train to Rotterdam. A home sits far.

          I studied the songs, the singers and songwriters, the social background, the messages, the lyrics that carry the messages, and the styles of writing. I discovered that the nostalgic messages in the music could reflect certain social realities and agenda: migration, urbanism, gentrification, and politics…

          I started to see the value of pop music as an art form. It is mass-produced, widely spread, easily consumed, passed on to next generations, and engraved in our collective memories. To know about society, culture, and language, it is important to tackle them through investigating pop music.

          On a personal level, I began to understand why it is important for me to write about nostalgia. I realised how much “home” and “homecoming” function as important domains of emotion in my life. My “home” is not a tangible reality. What lingers on my mind and makes me melancholic is not the apartment I share with my parents on the fifth floor of a dull flat. It is neither the grey, dusty reality in my home city Beijing. Somehow the “home” sits in a fairy tale land out there, it hides somewhere within the reality nonetheless.

          The word for “foreign land” in Chinese is “他鄉”. The same word in Japanese and Korean borrows the same construction:
          Mandarin Chinese: 他鄉 (tā xiāng)
          Japanese: 他た郷きょう (takyō)
          Korean: 타향 (他鄕, tahyang)

          The word-to-word translation into English is “other home”. It points to a “home” but a home belongs to others. It is a nostalgic and melancholic word because it subtly mourns for a displacement, as it is saying: “I don’t belong here”. The sense of belonging to a home is always present when the word is spoken.

          In a lot more words like this one, “home” functions as the root and key component. The notion of “home” in the Chinese language is prominent. This is why this thesis circles the word “home” and tries to explain the “homes” in places and times, embedded in the music.

          Nostalgia is about longing, especially for an unvisited place. It mourns for a displacement in time and space and yearns for either a realistic or a mythical return.

          Lo̍k-káng The Little Town is a song made in 1982 by the Taiwanese singer and songwriter Lo Ta-yu. People call him “the godfather of Taiwan music”. He has influenced many generations by his enlightening music and lyrics. And this song is one of the very first songs that made him known and recognised. Despite its musical value, it is an influential song as it shows big relevance to the time by criticising the urbanisation in Taiwan and mourning for the loss of rural life of people. Above all, it is a song of nostalgia that could hit everyone. “Taipei isn’t my home. My hometown has no neon light” is the iconic line that always lingers on, when someone misses home and the past, and is tortured by the metropolis. It carries not only a bitter sentiment but also a public complaint. Lo̍k-káng, a former unknown little town in Zhanghua, Taiwan, has become a symbol of peaceful rural living and the “good old days”. Lo̍k-káng then became a popular touristic spot and even a name for chain restaurants.

          However, generations of people who were so convinced that Lo̍k-káng is the hometown of Lo Ta-yu were “betrayed” by him. Lo had never been to Lo̍k-káng when he wrote the song. He revealed the story in an interview: Once he went to fix his motorbike in Taipei. He met this boy working at the repair shop and heard him saying: “It has been long I haven't been back home in Lo̍k-káng … I am having a hard time surviving here, and I have no face* going back.” (*In Chinese culture, having no face means that someone feels shameful. This boy had probably nothing to be proud of for his life then, so he would feel shameful in front of his family back home.) Lo was impressed and started to reflect on people’s suffering from urban-life stress. Therefore he wrote this song.

          Lo̍k-káng is a home neither of Lo Ta-yu nor most of the listeners. But everyone relates to it so much. The writer makes up a story based on a combination of their reality, other’s reality, and imagination. The recipient understands the story based on its relevance to reality but buys the story because of its distance to reality. This distance has created spaces for fantasies for both the songwriters and the listeners.

          Lo’s “betrayal” shows that, in a nostalgic narrative, it is not about going back to the real homes, but about longing for a different time, a different place, and better ones. Svetlana Boym, a media artist, playwright, and novelist, addresses it in Nostalgia and its discontents, that nostalgia is “not merely an individual sickness but a symptom of our age, a historical emotion” that could come from certain needs by the presence, “a rebellion against the modern idea of time, the time of history and progress”. Here, Lo Ta-yu expressed the urge for a “better” time, for a revisit to an unvisited place, where slow paces, nature, and religion are more valued. Even though he never visited the place himself, it could speak for him and the public. It is an urge that represents the public need, mixed with anger, sentiments, bitter-sweetness, and sweet-bitterness.

          A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty  is a song made by a heavy metal band formed in 1989 Beijing called Tang Dynasty—and perfectly explained their band name. Tang is an imperial dynasty ruling China from 618 to 907 and is famous for its great establishment in all kinds of aspects, such as its territorial expansion to central Asia, flourishing foreign trade (silk road), its art, literature, and religious life. In this song we could hear their scream for a return—a return to a fantasied world based on their knowledge of Tang Dynasty, where the economy, social structure, art and literature, as well as the cultural climate and people’s spirit are better. This imagined world is half an objective, factual construction, and half a virtual built-up, rendered with romanticism in the historical nostalgia: we can never return to the time.

          He Yong is from Beijing and wrote the song about Drum Bell Tower in 1994. The lyrics and music video both illustrated his life near the Drum Bell Tower and expressed his sadness and confusion when facing the fact that the neighbourhoods would lose the originality, the tradition, and its culture due to gentrification. Drum Bell Tower, same as Lo̍k-káng, has since become a token of nostalgia.

          Compared to Lo̍k-káng The Little Town and A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty, Drum Bell Tower is rather more “honest”, as it talks about a home the writer truly lived and the details he personally experienced. His nostalgia is about a wistful longing for a revisit to the visited.

          The iconic look of He Yong, which came out along with this song, tells another story. He always had a Breton shirt and a red scarf on. The red scarf is a neckerchief worn by young pioneers in China. It is a mandatory dress code in most Chinese elementary schools for three to sixth grades. The gesture of wearing a red scarf by He Yong might be a tribute to his childhood.

          Breton shirt was adopted by the Russian Navy in the 19th century from Brittany and became an iconic look and a symbolic item for Soviet sailors during World War II. It has turned into a symbol of loyalty, courage, and manhood. In 1950s China, with the growing friendship between China and Russia, the Breton shirt has come into fashion and gained popularity among men. It has its unique translation in Chinese: 海魂衫, meaning “soul-of-sea shirt”. In 1957, the film Soul of Sea was released in China. The communist propagandist portrait of the national navy has again successfully won the heart of the audience with the iconic Breton shirt. However, born in 1969, He Yong had not been one of them. Wearing a Breton shirt speaks of his nostalgia for the time he didn't live in.

          Red scarf and Breton shirt—two symbolic items are both a tribute to the past of two timeframes. He Yong had lived in the former but had not lived in the latter. Playing with time, memories, and reminiscence, He has created a successful nostalgic collage. It has become a symbol, not only of He Yong but also of Beijing’s early rock scene. Until today, many people would still wear a Breton shirt and red scarf when going to rock music festivals.

          Nostalgia is a wistful gaze at a faraway place in time and space, a gesture of mourning for the displacement and yearning for a return. Nostalgia is also about belonging to a place or a community—the relationship between individuals and collectives—one must feel belonging to a place/time so that he would long for returning the place/time. One type of belonging is about belonging to a nation. The nostalgic feeling would hit, when one is outside of the homeland, no matter if the homeland sits in the presence, the past, the reality, or a mythical place.

          The Orphan of Asia, another famous song by Lo Ta-yu in the year 1983, sings about the wish for a return and a sense of belonging to the homeland—China (the “mother”), from a perspective of Taiwan (the “orphan”) in a certain time of history (the “White Terror”).

          The White Terror in this context is the suppression of political dissidents when martial law ruled Taiwan for 38 years from 1949 to 1987. It was triggered by an anti-government uprising against Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party)’s corrupted conduct in 1947. Many people, whether were real or perceived as anti-Kuomintang, were imprisoned and killed in the early period. In the later period of White Terror, there was still harsh censorship on all cultural products.

          Taiwan, the “orphan of Asia” through Lo’s narrative, expressed its state of abandonment from China and isolation in Asia. After WWII, Japan stopped its colonial rule in Taiwan and handed over Taiwan to the Republic of China. After this, Kuomintang treated Taiwanese people by its corrupted conduct and violence. Taiwanese people had not enjoyed it long in the joy of returning to the motherland until realising how bad the motherland was treating them. Orphans of Asia is an outburst of the long-repressed confusion, sorrow, mourning, and yearning: mother, why is it so?

          The nostalgia towards the motherland easily habituates in the Chinese cultural context, because there is a strong connection between a Chinese individual and the country. This connection roots in Chinese philosophy and language. Confucianism emphasises collectivism and hierarchy. It values the state as the top component of the world, and the family as the top component of a state. In this value system, state and family are strongly connected—and this idea is still very present in today’s China as we can see slogans such as “the country is the home. The home is the country”. This set of values had an etymological impact on the invention and development of the word “country”. The word “country” in Chinese is composed of two characters which respectively mean “nation” and “family/home”. It was a word meaning the imperial dynasty named after the family name of the emperor. Along with the idea of modern country, this word has developed into a word for “country” in modern Chinese.

          The Confucianism backing and the etymological root support each other. Both in the consciousness(Confucianism values) and the unconsciousness(linguistic), a Chinese person always tends to connect the home to the country. By doing this, an individual builds a sort of intimacy with their homeland. Because it helps an idea of a state slip through your private zone and into your kinship. Especially when an individual is away from his homeland or feels any sort of forced departure or separation from his homeland, he feels the intimacy fused with nostalgia. And this departure or separation doesn't necessarily mean a physical one—you don't have to be physically away from your homeland, but also can be ideologically abandoned by a homeland, which was the situation depicted by Lo Ta-yu.

          While the patriot belonging roots in the Chinese culture and has its etymologic backing, the voluntary exile from the motherland is less favourable, both from a cultural and political sense. The “Fernweh” and “Wanderlust”, could be seen as a rebellious act, a denial of the national intimacy, and a breakup with the motherland.

          Olive Tree was released in 1979 in Taiwan. It is well known for its remarkable role in the Taiwan folk song movement and pop music history because it was the first time classical music composition was introduced to pop music. Its beautiful, yet sad melody has passed on to generations of people.

          This song could be about anything but a political message. However, it was banned by the Taiwan authority for eight years. The lyrics were originally from a poem by Sanmao (Echo), a Taiwanese writer who is famous for her travel-writing. This poem is clearly her true heart of “Fernweh”. The Taiwan authority at that time had the opinion that this song conveyed a passive message about despair, and that it talked about leaving to the mainland / overseas.

          Nostalgia is expressed in a different kind of language in China, in contrast to the west. In Chinese songwriting, it is a common attitude and technique to be universal, unspecific, impersonal, and to have vastness. The reasons behind deal with a complex combination of Chinese culture, the language, and semantics, and the author’s self-censorship as a reaction to the top-down censorship on cultural products. The “home”, in many nostalgic narratives in Chinese music, does not pinpoint an exact home of a person but could be applied to a general audience instead.

          The “home”, which The Orphan of Asia cries for, has multiple alternative versions of interpretation and relates to different social events. Lo and his audience seem to be able to accept all of the versions. In fact, the song has been always able to disclaim its connection to THAT White Terror, the one from 1949 to 1987 in Taiwan.

          Version 1: Since the song COULD BE about a very sensitive political issue, it could be banned by the government at that time, under the censorship on cultural products in the time of martial law. To avoid censorship, the graphic designer in Lo’s album production team came with an idea. He suggested Lo to add a note under the title of the song “A red nightmare — to all the refugees in Indo-China”. “Refugees in Indo-China”, according to Lo, referred to the leftover in Kuomintang troops that fled to the Burmese border region in 1950 after their defeat to the Communists in the Chinese Civil War. This social event was way less sensitive than the White Terror. Thanks to this note, the song was not censored. And many people have since believed that the song is about refugees in Indo-China.

          Version 2: In a recent TV program featuring Lo Ta-yu in 2016 hosted a Taiwanese famous music critic Ma Shifang, Lo was asked about this additional note on stage. He said the song is out of his sympathy for the refugees in Vietnam War, and he was inspired to making the song, after seeing the famous photograph of Phan Thi Kim Phuc, namely The Napalm Girl. The photograph captured her fear and pain in a South Vietnamese napalm attack.

          Version 3: Lo performed this song at a benefit concert in 1991 in Hong Kong. In that year, a heavy flood hit eastern China and China was in aid for flood relief. This concert was held for a charity purpose. Lo went on the stage and sat in front of the piano. He said: “This song was written a long time ago. But today it should still sound honest”. He started playing. The camera then later zoomed out. On the LED screen on the stage, slogans said: “Drinking the same river, giving the same red heart” and “Blood must be thicker than water”. In this context, the “Orphan of Asia” represents easter China in a state of natural catastrophe. And it promotes solidarity within, through the rhetorics about motherhood and bonding.

          I believe Lo does not want the song to narrow down on one specific home. It refuses to be specific. The message is vague and open for interpretation. He wants to talk about motherhood from a Pan Asian perspective and apply it to whomever could relate to abandonment, isolation, confusion, and nostalgia. What Lo wants to say is: “it could happen here and now, but also there and then.”

          The choices of words in the song and the characteristics of the Chinese language have a big impact on its vagueness. In Chinese, a word, or a term is composed of multiple characters. A word/term has very many versions of its substitutes, in which only a single character is altered. For the term “White Terror/白色恐怖/bái sè kǒng bù”, Lo used an altered word “白色恐懼/bái sè kǒng jù”, which only alters the last character and still carries the same literal meaning. However, this altered version for “white terror” does not resonate with the historical term anymore, since it has lost its specification and precision, and a historical term is in most cases specific and precise. There could be many reasons why Lo chose this word. It could be that he wants it to rhyme, or it could be out of self-censorship.

          Here are two examples of English-written songs to demonstrate a very rough comparison between Chinese lyrics and English lyrics in contemporary pop music.
          In Norwegian Wood by The Beatles, the protagonist describes a simple story of an affair. The narrative is emotionless, objective, and diary-like. The plain tone seems not to have any effort in establishing further meaning other than retelling the facts. Thus, there is no evidence showing if the protagonist has any emotional connection with this encounter. Instead, he throws out random details in the event that people wouldn’t expect knowing—why would a listener want to know if she said anything about Norwegian wood? But the listeners eventually know what had happened in the story. And they can still notice that the protagonist is a bit underwhelmed. There is a sort of sadness or disappointment in it, but very minimised.

          In contrast to it, The Orphan of Asia doesn't describe anything that actually happened. It is not a chronological diary, but rather a collage of metaphors. There is no such a child crying in the wind, with red mud on his yellow face—these are all metaphorical expressions to express the feeling of abandonment.

          After The Beatles, musicians in modern music industries in the west have invented various music genres and written songs in all kinds of tones in favour of different social needs and trends. Diving into the vast sea of all types of English lyrics, I have come to the finding that, despite many nuances between one to another, songwriters in English lyrics writing (majorly from U.S, U.K and Australia) all prefer to write in the first person and individual perspective, also to share very personal stories and opinions. They like to zoom in on very particular things and expose an amazing amount of details of them. Instead, if we look at Chinese songwriting, we would notice there is less of “I” and more “we”. Songwriters would not waste any more words on describing what they did and whom they met. A more collective narrative, a bigger scope of time and space, and a more general point of view are more preferable in Chinese songwriting.

          The Smashing Pumpkins’ song 1979 is one of the most nostalgic songs in alternative rock. The year 1979 is when the band’s frontman Billy Corgan turned 12, a transition into an adolescence. This song is a reminiscence of Corgan’s youth. The seemingly unnecessary details of events show an opposite approach in the writing compared to the Chinese ones from Lo Ta-yu and Chyi Yu, in which we find rather a lot more fictional and metaphorical elements. The former aims to sound real, personal, and honest; the latter tries to sound general, vast, and resonant with everyone. The former speaks out of the mouth, the latter wants to rhyme and recite.
        </div>
         <div id="txc4" style="display:none">
           Since nostalgia is about longing for the past, the perception of “past” and the conception of time directly have an impact on how nostalgia works. The Chinese conception of time can be seen sometimes as a non-linear one. We can trace it out not only in traditional Chinese literature and philosophy, but also through the nostalgic narratives in pop music.

           Moon Represents My Heart is a song that every east/south/south-eastern Asian can sing even without understanding Chinese. For almost half a century, it has sold and traveled to many places in Asia and is often cited as “one of the most famous and beloved Chinese songs of all time”. But has there anybody ever asked, “why does the moon represent my heart?”

           It is never explained in the song itself or by the songwriter. There is no logical connection being explained in the song between “moon” and “my love/my heart”. It seems like everybody already gets the idea. I believed that the moon has been long a common literary imagery in the Chinese language and culture so that no explanation is needed here. It had already been largely used in poetry and has gained its top popularity among poets in Tang and Song dynasties (AD 618 - 1279).

           I raised my head and looked out on the mountain moon,
           I bowed my head and thought of my far-off home.

           A Tranquil Night by Li bai

           This is the first Chinese poem we learn as a child. Moon already slips through even before we could form a sentence. Moon is engraved in common knowledge for Chinese-speaking as an imagery represents nostalgia and eternity: when you look at the moon, you know someone else is also looking at it. You know you, or someone else was looking at the same moon in the past. The moon is the same moon, but the time is a different time now. Then you miss the person, the home, and the time far away from you.

           The philosophical meaning of the moon and how it functions as a motive for nostalgic texts has something to do with the Chinese philosophical conception of time. Shuchen Xiang, a scholar of Department of Philosophy, University of York, explains it as follows:

           “Unlike the Western tradition which treats time as an inferior to
           eternal being, the Chinese tradition understands the reality of experience within
           becoming itself. The remembrance of time’s passing thus becomes a kind of
           metaphysical experience, to remember the past is to remember that humans are
           indelibly part of an eternal cycle of change.”

           And the moon is the perfect natural reference to help materialise this understanding—the moon always changes and the change itself is eternal. in Water Song, a poem in the Song Dynasty, Su Shi wrote: “People have sorrow and joy; they part and meet again and again. The moon dims or shines; it waxes and wanes again and again.”

           This conception of time in the cycle of change suggests an alternative way of looking at time-passing in Chinese nostalgic pop songs. In the world of the moon, time is not linear. The remembrance of old times, places, and people doesn’t point at the impossibilities of going back. Instead, it advocates the acceptance of the constant return and constant departure.

           In Love Song 1990, Lo wrote about the nostalgia for an old lover and the old times. The narrative is about the remembrance of the lover in the past and the sadness for the change in the present. Besides this linear conception of “past-present”, there is another non-linear conception of time in the lyrics. It plays with time, and “time” plays together with “space”. The “past”, “present” and “future”, together with “here” and “there”, are woven together.

           Maybe, tomorrow(forwards in time) in the sunset, when the tired bird flew back to nest(backward in space),
           you may also set forth(forwards in space) on a return journey(backward in space) to old times(backward in time).

           With these lines, this song suggests a gesture that looks both back and forward. the protagonist is looking forward to a return, in an unconventional construction of time-space. In here, “becoming” is at the same time “returning”. The “back” and “forth”, “becoming” and “returning” do not oppose each other. Instead, they are all circling. These two lines set out a tune of hope in the song, saying “my old lover and I will still meet again”. Yet the realisation of it stays mysterious.

          Svetlana Boym, in Nostalgia and its discontents, introduces a typology for nostalgia: restorative nostalgia which attempts a reconstruction of the lost home, and reflective nostalgia that focuses on the longing itself and delays the homecoming. The “home” in restorative nostalgia is about the origin, the tradition, the truth, the universal values, and the homeland, while “home” in reflective nostalgia is about the past in an irreversible time and the remembrance of it.

          It can be proved that there is a mixture of both restorative and reflective nostalgia in one song and its consumption (how people understand it and use it). The attempt of restoration and the remembrance of homes can happen at the same time. Sometimes they can transform from one to another.

          The song Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies is a folder of such a mixture. The nostalgic consumption deals with both the facts around the musician and the message in the music itself.

          The reflective nostalgia here, is about mourning for the lost member, for the “good old days” when he was alive, and how this period connects to the memory of the audience their own. The frontman and vocalist of the influential Hong Kong rock band Beyond, Wong Ka Kui, is for decades worshiped as the greatest musician in Hong Kong. He died from an accident during an entertainment show in Japan in 1993, the same year when he wrote this song. The song has become one of the most symbolic songs of Beyond and an elegy for Wong. The death of Wong remarks the end of the band’s most glorious period. Furthermore, the time when Wong played in Beyond, is also connected to the “good old days” in individual memories of the listeners. For the audience, the sorrow of Wong’s death is linked to a bitter sentiment about the loss of their own childhood and youth.

          In the restorative nostalgia, people’s reminiscence of Wong and the “good old days” of Hong Kong, shifts to a longing for the coming back to the “golden age” of Hong Kong and an attempt to restore the values of democracy and freedom in the society, encouraged by the message in the song:

          Forgive me for indulging in my freedom all my life
          Even though I am afraid one day I will stumble and fall

          Regardless of the context where Wong wrote about freedom, the audience has brought “freedom” to a political context and used it in political rhetorics, where “freedom” directly links to freedom of speech and civil liberties. As a result, this song is used as an anthem for many social movements such as protests and events of memorials in Hong Kong.

          In the Anti-Hong Kong Express Rail Link movement in 2010, people gathered around the Legislative Council Building and started to sing Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies. Someone in the crowd asked: “if Ka Kui were alive, would he be with us today?” and someone answered: “Ka Kui is right here!” On October 1st 2014, the National Day of the People’s Republic of China, thousands of protesters in OCLP (Occupy Central with Love and Peace, a social campaign that advocates for a democratic electoral system) were singing this song while holding their cell phone’s flashlight in hands.

          Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies was also used as an anthem in 2019-20 Hong Kong protests(Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement), where there has grown a strong nostalgic rhetoric. In the situation of Hong Kong in 2020, people witnessed a rapid decrease of democratic conduct under the increasing pressure from Beijing. They have also seen a loss of social safety in local circumstances and a loss of statues in an international context (Trump ordered the removal of special statues enjoyed by Hong Kong due to Beijing’s new national security law). These shreds of evidence and experiences of loss have resulted in a growing political nostalgia among people: "It was better yesterday. Hong Kong had more democracy and autonomy, and its people enjoyed more freedom in the past.” Indulging in this reminiscence of the better past, the people thrived to gain their rights back.

          Here, this restorative nostalgia is fuelled by the reflective nostalgia. People who feel sorrowful for Wong, for the loss of the “good old days” of both their youth and the society, tend to turn this sentiment into power in action in restoring the “good old days”. At the same time, the restorative action can also be discouraged and delayed by the reflective one, as soon as it decides to see the irreversibility of time and the impracticality of re-establishing the past. The restorative nostalgia will shift to a reflective one, once the restoration passion breaks down to a fragmental, personal remembrance of details in individual memories of the past.

          The way people consume this song shows a constant swing between these two types of nostalgia. There is a dynamic mixture and a grey area between the two ends.

          Although reflective nostalgia seems to suggest a permanent delay of the act of restoration, it is not equivalent to being powerless. Boym’s “diasporic intimacy” describes a state of nostalgia of immigrants, who live in voluntary or involuntary exile: they understand the limitations of nostalgia and challenge nostalgia through cherishing “non-native, elective affinities”. They accept the inability to return and turn it into an enabling force. Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies is also a song to carry the diasporic intimacy.

          In 2017, a video on Youtube got viral and reached 8 million views. The title is: “A Japanese version of Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies performed on Tokyo’s street. A girl didn’t know he is Chinese, and cried in tears when he switched to Cantonese.”

          In this video, a girl was watching the street artist’s performing the song Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies in Japanese. She started to cry when he started to sing in Cantonese because it surprised her that the artist could sing the song in its original language and that he speaks her mother tongue and he is Chinese.

          The performer, Wang Xiaokang told the story in an interview: It happened in January 2016. He didn’t know the girl is Chinese until she started to sing along in Cantonese. Then he started to sing in Cantonese too. He talked to the girl and got to know that she got married and moved from China to here 16 years ago. She missed home very much and was surprised that there was a street performer in Tokyo from China.

          In this context, this song carries out the homesickness of Chinese in Japan. And this homesickness applies to the Chinese-speaking/ethnic Chinese diaspora (from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, etc) elsewhere all around the world. In the comments below the video, immigrant workers in the U.S, Japan, Australia, and Europe all have similar stories. They shared their experiences of hearing this song in a foreign place. It reminded them of home and the past. And the good memories could support them so that life goes on. They also talked about how much this song could bond people with different nationalities but the same linguistic common ground and similar immigration background. One person commented: “As long as there are ethnic Chinese people, there are boundless oceans and vast skies.”

          They do not look for a cure for this homesickness. Their nostalgia accepts the inability of homecoming—it verbalises and embraces the sentiments within. At the same time, it enables resonation and bonding experiences. “Homecoming” is replaced by “homemaking” as a strategy of survival.

          Whenever someone in karaoke orders the song Romantic Cellphones by Jay Chou, the whole crowd would get hyper-excited and start to sing along to it. Romantic Cellphones narrates a story, where a girl dials the wrong number and ends up talking to a stranger. They then somehow fall in love. Besides the cheesy love story, the song is also an advertisement theme song for Panasonic MX6, the shiny clamshell cellphone that every teen once dreamt of having. The graphics and image in the music video carry so much about the nostalgia of us, the millennials. They remind us of the school days when we had to type SMS under school desks, flip back the phone to take a selfie, phone accessories hanging excessively.

          Without the music video screened on the TV or the crowd who sing together, this song would not bring this much excitement. Karaoke creates a situation, where people can indulge in nostalgia.

          Karaoke bars and home karaoke machines play a very big role in Asian societies as a very unique type of entertainment. It is a space for very intimate gatherings. Singing karaoke serves as a channel for releasing and expressing feelings. It enables a multi-dimensional relation between the audience and music. People watch the music video with subtitles while listening / singing to the songs. In a situation like this, both the singer and the song piece become the “duo centre" of the space — this is different from a stage performance where the singer is rather the only centre. In karaoke, people enjoy watching the music videos of the songs. It is a cinematic presentation, a solid performance itself. This allows people to focus more on the songs, on how to understand the songs, and how to interact with the songs with their performances. Karaoke functions as a link between the song pieces and the people they reach.

          Karaoke is a place to host nostalgia. It connects the “now and here” with the “then and there”—the singers who sang it, the times they belong, and our memories linked to it. It renders the fiction into the reality, the past into the present, and the universal into the specific. It enables the verbalisation of a personal, temporary emotion and empathy of others. It enables people not only to reminisce but also to re-visit the past.

          Karaoke offers a tool for remembrance, both of the lyrics and of the language itself. At the karaoke event I hosted at Verhalenhuis Belvédère in Rotterdam, many of the participants are second-generation Chinese whose parents immigrated to the Netherlands. They ordered songs in Cantonese but needed the pinyin annotation (pinyin: the Romanisation of the Chinese characters based on their pronunciation). With the help both of pinyin and the “sing-along” text effect, they could easily manage the lyrics despite the language barrier. The karaoke sing-along text with pinyin is a resolution to the language barrier for second-generation Chinese. The “lost mother tongue” is not the major one they use in daily life, rather the one they memorise, and has a certain connotation to childhood memories, especially to their experiences talking to elder family members (first-generation immigrants, or families in home countries). Karaoke sing-along text makes it possible for people to reconnect to memories, feelings, and sentiments that are embedded in the languages.

          I almost feel nostalgic, when I recall how I started writing the thesis: my eyes would get wet when listening to He Yong singing about Yinding bridge—I miss the bridge, I miss home—I thought I should talk about it. I thought: what if the thesis could resolve the homesickness in me? This journey of writing brought me to realisation that my personal homesickness never heals. Neither does the nostalgia of a society find the best vaccine.

          If I am nostalgic, the society also is. The humankind is, too. Nostalgia is not only an individual melancholy that hides inside a diary under a pillow but also a social epidemic of a group, a nation, a generation, and a century. People hear the home calling—no matter if it exists in the map or the timeline.

          But nostalgia is far more than a hopeless diagnosis. It is a fuel, driving the crowd towards a revolution. It is a drug, healing the sickness of the same name. The former defends, they stand for truth. The latter hallucinates, they fall into dreams.

          It is a beautiful journey for me to understand the nostalgia in Chinese societies of certain times. All the way long, this is about a nostalgic person understanding her nostalgic country and how her mother tongue expresses nostalgia.


          Am I back there yet?—PARTYWORLD, the giant building with a dozen floors of private lounges, each decorated with plastic rococo and disco balls. Which room did we enter? How many hours did we order? Have we sung the clamshell phone song yet? Did the boy sing the song along with me? What has just happened, did I just confess to him? How did the song end and how did the next song enter? Oh, did we just order the same song again? I don't remember. But I do. Many moments dilute in the hot summer steam and fade away. They will, one day, suddenly get crystallised in your head. My friend pat me on my shoulder: “The hours ran out. It’s time to go home.”

          “I am drunk. Will you walk home with me?” We are still singing on the way.
